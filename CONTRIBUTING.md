  - Programming contributions should solve at least one file or one function and be more than 10 lines of code
  - Contributions that solve an existing issue will also be accepted as long as the issue is more than just a typo

## For Beginners: 
- Fork this repo
- Look over the repository and find an area you would like to work on
  - a good first project would be to pick an incomplete function to work on within project.
  - a good first documentation project would be good to go contribute 2+ paragraphs and a diagram or 3+ paragraphs without a diagram
- Once you have decided what you would like to work on create comments within the code outlining your chosen contribution
  - If you picked a function to work on create comments with basic pseudocode describing how you will solve the problem or if applicable modify existing pseudocode.
  
  
  - For documentation create a comment in the README.md file with your overall topic and a comment on what each paragraph will focus on
  - For any section in the code you would like to work on create a comment indicating you plan on working on that section.
